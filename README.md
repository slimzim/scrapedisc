### Overview

Scrapdisc is a full-stack application (Node.js, MongoDB, Express, Handlebars) that scrapes the internet's most widely read classical music blog (Slippedisc) and saves article data to a MongoDB and renders it to an HTML page.  The user is able to save their favorite articles and pin notes to an article, both of which are saved in the MongoDB.  The app is simple to use, but complex under the hood!  Visit the link below to try the application.  Hit the Scrape button at the top of the page, and the rest is self explanatory!
